Instruction on working on TurtleBot 

1. Install sshpass which is used for making an ssh connection to the robot:

sudo apt-get install sshpass


2. Connect to the AMRL-5G network (the password is 7DigitPrecision) and make sure the robot is also connected to the same network by running the following command in the terminal:

ping 192.168.1.10


3. Put the file TurtleBot_Initialization.sh in a folder containing only the zip file of your ROS package.
 
4. Go to the folder containing TurtleBot_Initialization.sh and run:
./TurtleBot_Initialization.sh 

You may have to use chmod to change the execution permission.

This will automatically port your code to the robot, build it and also initialize the robot by running the required nodes on the robot.
 
5- Open another terminal and ssh to the robot using the following command:
ssh cobot-m@192.168.1.10

6. cd ~/COMPSCI403/assignment5/submissions/

7. rosrun compsci403_assignment5 compsci403_assignment5
